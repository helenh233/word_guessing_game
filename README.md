# Game where you can set a custom "secret word" for others to guess.
## There is no limit to how many times a player can guess.
## Each letter of a guess is evaluated and reprinted as follows:
#   lowercase: letter exists in secret, but not in correct position
#   UPPERCASE: letter in correct position
#   . (period): letter does not exist in secret word
## All previously revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses.
